# *Counter-Strike 2 Match and Strategic Insight Prediction*

## Project Description
This project investigates outcome prediction and strategic insight in *Counter-Strike 2 (CS2)*, focusing on predicting round-level and match-level winners and extracting interpretable signals about team strategy and communication. Utilizing a dataset from HLTV and betting odds, our goal is to create accurate, lightweight, and accessible predictive and analytical tools. This work aims to bridge the gap between academic esports research and practical applications for players, teams, analysts, and fans, enriching the community with actionable insights.
