✓ Reproducible scripts (data_exploration.py, create_visualizations.py)

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
→ T-side wins 63.4% of rounds (imbalanced but expected in competitive CS2)
→ Top predictor: CT elimination (54.3% correlation with T wins)
→ Second predictor: Bomb explosion (49.3% correlation with T wins)
→ Rifles account for 65.5% of all kills
→ Average headshot rate: 50.8%
→ Average kill distance: 17.5 units
→ 10 PCA components needed to explain 90% of variance

READY FOR DECISION TREE MODELING:
----------------------------------
✓ rounds_with_features.csv - Main dataset for modeling
  - 71 samples × 24 features
  - Target variable: t_win (binary 0/1)
  - All features interpretable and meaningful
  
✓ rounds_transformed.csv - Advanced modeling
  - Includes log-transformed features
  - Standardized and normalized versions
  - 77 total feature columns

✓ rounds_pca.csv - Dimensionality reduced
  - 10 principal components (90% variance)
  - Reduces overfitting risk
  - 71 samples × 12 columns (10 PCs + winner + t_win)

RECOMMENDED MODELING APPROACH:
-------------------------------
1. Use rounds_with_features.csv as primary dataset
2. Target variable: t_win (T-side victory = 1, CT-side victory = 0)
3. Start with top 10 correlated features
4. Use 5-fold cross-validation (small sample size)
5. Limit tree depth to 4-6 to prevent overfitting
6. Consider Random Forest for ensemble approach
7. Expected accuracy: 70-80% based on correlation analysis

NEXT STEP:
----------
Run decision tree analysis using rounds_with_features.csv

Suggested code to start:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('analysis_output/rounds_with_features.csv')

# Select features (top 10 correlated with t_win)
features = ['ct_eliminated', 'bomb_exploded', 'total_kills', 
            'headshot_rate', 'rifle_kills', 'avg_kill_distance',
            'bomb_defused', 't_eliminated', 'max_kill_distance',
            'wallbang_kills']

X = df[features]
y = df['t_win']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Train decision tree
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
print("Accuracy:", dt.score(X_test, y_test))
print("\nCross-validation scores:", cross_val_score(dt, X, y, cv=5))
```
