FINAL CLUSTERING RESULTS - KEEP THESE FILES
============================================

PRIMARY SCRIPT (Use This):
  ✓ comprehensive_player_clustering.py  - All-in-one script with balanced clustering

RESULTS (Most Accurate):
  ✓ final_results/
    - player_roles_balanced.png         - Improved PCA visualization (23.3% vs 76.7% balance)
    - role_distribution_balanced.png    - Bar chart showing better balance
    - role_heatmap_balanced.png        - Feature comparison heatmap
    - player_roles_final.csv           - Final role assignments

  ✓ enhanced_clustering_features/
    - player_features.csv              - Extracted features for all players

OLD RESULTS (For Comparison Only):
  ⚠️  clustering_results/              - Old performance-level clustering (97% vs 3% imbalance)
  ⚠️  player_role_clustering/          - Old player clustering (87% vs 13% imbalance)

DOCUMENTATION:
  ✓ KEEP_THESE_FILES.txt (this file) - Explains what to use

FILES TO DELETE (Outdated/Redundant):
  ✗ extract_player_role_features_enhanced.py  - Merged into comprehensive script
  ✗ advanced_player_clustering.py             - Merged into comprehensive script  
  ✗ player_aggregated_clustering.py           - Merged into comprehensive script
  ✗ README_CLUSTERING_PROJECT.md              - Outdated methodology
  ✗ CLUSTERING_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md            - Outdated results
  ✗ FINAL_SUMMARY.md                          - Outdated summary

WHY THE IMPROVEMENT:
====================
The new script addresses the severe class imbalance by:
1. Using a combined scoring metric (silhouette * balance_penalty)
2. Better feature selection
3. Smarter role identification

RESULTS COMPARISON:
==================
Old Clustering:
  - Entry Fraggers: 12 players (13%) - Too extreme
  - Support Players: 78 players (87%) - Too broad

New Clustering:
  - Entry Fragger: 21 players (23.3%) ✓ Better balance
  - Balanced Player: 69 players (76.7%) ✓ More reasonable

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Delete old Python scripts (merged into comprehensive_player_clustering.py)
2. Keep final_results/ as the authoritative source
3. Archive old clustering_results/ and player_role_clustering/ for reference
4. Download 40+ more demos to get 4-6 distinct roles

HOW TO RUN:
===========
$ cd /Users/lukerobinson/Dropbox/school/csci_5502/CS_ANALYTICS_DM/machine_learning/clustering
$ python3 comprehensive_player_clustering.py

This will:
  1. Extract features from all parsed demos
  2. Aggregate by player
  3. Perform balanced clustering
  4. Generate visualizations in final_results/
