ANALYSIS CORRECTED - FALSE CORRELATIONS REMOVED
================================================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
Original analysis incorrectly included "outcome variables" as predictive features:
  ❌ ct_eliminated (if TRUE, CT-side loses by definition)
  ❌ t_eliminated (if TRUE, T-side loses by definition)
  ❌ bomb_exploded (if TRUE, T-side wins by definition)
  ❌ bomb_defused (if TRUE, CT-side wins by definition)

These created FALSE hot spots in the correlation heatmap with ~50% correlations
because they are DETERMINISTIC outcomes, not predictive features.

CORRECTION APPLIED:
-------------------
✓ Modified data_exploration.py to exclude outcome variables
✓ Modified create_visualizations.py to exclude outcome variables from:
  - Correlation heatmap (Visualization #6)
  - Feature importance plot (Visualization #12)
✓ Regenerated all analysis outputs
✓ Regenerated all 13 visualizations

REVISED FINDINGS (Realistic):
------------------------------
Now using ONLY gameplay metrics that occur DURING the round:
  • total_kills, headshot_kills, headshot_rate
  • rifle_kills, awp_kills, pistol_kills, smg_kills
  • smoke_kills, wallbang_kills, assisted_kills
  • avg_kill_distance, max_kill_distance, min_kill_distance
  • total_damage, avg_damage_per_kill

Top Predictive Features (by correlation with t_win):
  1. total_damage:        -17.4% (favors CT)
  2. total_kills:         -17.4% (favors CT)
  3. headshot_kills:      -13.3% (favors CT)
  4. avg_damage_per_kill: -12.6% (favors CT)
  5. headshot_rate:       -10.3% (favors CT)
  6. max_kill_distance:   +8.7%  (favors T)
  7. avg_kill_distance:   +8.2%  (favors T)
  8. wallbang_kills:      +7.6%  (favors T)

INTERPRETATION:
---------------
CT-Side Wins When:
  → Higher total damage output
  → More total eliminations
  → Better headshot accuracy
  → Higher damage efficiency

T-Side Wins When:
  → Longer engagement distances (map control)
  → More wallbang kills (tactical aggression)
  → Better positioning (control distances)

WHY CORRELATIONS ARE WEAK (<20%):
----------------------------------
This is EXPECTED and REALISTIC because:
  • Round outcomes depend on hundreds of micro-decisions
  • Team coordination not captured in data
  • Economy/utility usage not measured
  • Map-specific positions not tracked
  • Player roles/strategies not included
  • Small sample size (71 rounds)

UPDATED VISUALIZATIONS:
-----------------------
All 13 plots regenerated in: analysis_output/plots/

Key changes:
  • Heatmap now shows realistic weak correlations
  • No false hot spots from outcome variables
  • Feature importance shows actual predictive power
  • All interpretations are now honest and defensible

DECISION TREE RECOMMENDATIONS:
-------------------------------
Expected Performance:
  • Baseline: 63.4% (always predict T-side)
  • Expected ML: 65-75% accuracy
  • Use cross-validation (small sample)
  • Limit tree depth (max_depth=4-6)

Recommended Features (start simple):
  1. total_damage
  2. headshot_rate  
  3. max_kill_distance

Or use top 7-10 correlated features for better coverage.

Sample Code:
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('analysis_output/rounds_with_features.csv')

# Features (NO outcome variables!)
features = ['total_damage', 'total_kills', 'headshot_rate', 
            'max_kill_distance', 'avg_kill_distance']
X = df[features]
y = df['t_win']

# Train with overfitting prevention
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=4, min_samples_leaf=5, random_state=42)

# Evaluate with cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(dt, X, y, cv=5)
print(f"Accuracy: {scores.mean():.2%} (+/- {scores.std():.2%})")
```

HONEST ASSESSMENT:
------------------
✓ Methodologically sound (no cheating with outcome variables)
✓ Realistically interpreted (weak correlations acknowledged)
✓ Defensible results (modest expectations)
✓ Ready for decision tree modeling

The analysis is now CORRECT and can be confidently used for:
  • Academic presentation
  • Decision tree modeling
  • Honest discussion of limitations
  • Publication/portfolio work

FILES UPDATED:
--------------
Code:
  ✓ machine_learning/data_exploration.py
  ✓ machine_learning/create_visualizations.py

Data:
  ✓ analysis_output/rounds_with_features.csv (20 features, no outcomes)
  ✓ analysis_output/rounds_transformed.csv (updated)
  ✓ analysis_output/rounds_pca.csv (updated, 8 components for 90% variance)
  ✓ analysis_output/feature_correlations.csv (corrected)
  ✓ analysis_output/summary_statistics.csv (updated)

Visualizations (all 13 regenerated):
  ✓ analysis_output/plots/*.png

Documentation:
  ✓ REVISED_FINDINGS.md (detailed explanation)
  ✓ CORRECTION_SUMMARY.txt (this file)

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Review updated visualizations (especially #6 heatmap, #12 importance)
2. Read REVISED_FINDINGS.md for detailed interpretation
3. Proceed with decision tree modeling using rounds_with_features.csv
4. Expect modest accuracy (65-75%) and be honest about it
5. Focus on interpretation of the tree structure, not just accuracy
